Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh.

I received my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. 

I am honored to have been selected for the [REStud Tour 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/restudtour2023/home).

My research interests are in microeconomic theory with a focus on learning, information, behavioral economics, and dynamic games.
